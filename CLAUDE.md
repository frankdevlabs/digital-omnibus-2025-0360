# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A personal, open **legislative tracker** — not a software project. It follows one EU file:
**2025/0360 (COD)**, the Commission's *Digital Omnibus* proposal **COM(2025) 837 final** (19 Nov 2025)
on the data/cyber strand (GDPR, ePrivacy/cookies, P2B, cyber incident-reporting).

**Scope guard:** this repo tracks `2025/0360 (COD)` **only**. It is *not* the AI-Act Digital Omnibus
`2025/0359 (COD)` — a separate, faster file. Keep them apart (see `docs/instruments/repealed.md`).

There is no build, no app, no test suite. The "code" is Markdown + YAML + three Python skill drivers.

## Three-layer architecture (the big picture)

The repo deliberately separates three layers so links stay stable as the file evolves:

| Layer | Folder | What it is | Mutability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary sources** | `sources/` | Register of every official document; PDFs/DOCX committed (incl. LIMITE — see `NOTICE` §2) | append-only |
| **Operative-text extracts** | `extracts/` | Diffable plain-text transcriptions of the operative articles, one set per version | versioned |
| **Analysis** | `docs/` | Human-readable analysis linking *down* into the two layers above | living |

`extracts/commission/` is the **base text** (the Commission proposal — the diff baseline).
`extracts/council/` holds one five-file set **per Council compromise version** (`ST-6406`, `ST-8261-1-26-REV1`,
`ST-9547` …), structured identically so `git diff` between versions is meaningful. The five files per
version are always: `_gdpr-art3-amendments`, `_eprivacy-art5`, `_cyber-art6-9`, `_final-art10-11`, `_recitals`.
`extracts/parliament/` holds **EP committee texts** (draft opinions, draft reports, tabled amendments),
**one file per committee document** (`JURI-PA-789142_draft-opinion.md`, …). These are *not* consolidated
like the Council texts — they are discrete numbered amendments in two-column tables, transcribed as
tabled (see `extracts/parliament/_TRANSCRIPTION_GUIDE.md`).

## Single sources of truth (don't hand-edit downstream copies)

- **`data/documents.yaml`** is the canonical document register. `sources/README.md` is its *rendered*
  table — edit the YAML, then update the table to match. Never edit the table alone.
- **`data/tracker-state.yaml`** is **auto-maintained by the daily tracker routine** (a scheduled remote
  agent that hashes watched source pages T1-*/T2-*/T3-*). The header says "Do not edit by hand" — respect it.
- **`data/positions.csv`** backs the institutional/provision comparison; keep it in sync with the
  `docs/provisions/*` and `docs/institutional-positions.md` prose.
- **`STATUS.md`** is the one-screen current snapshot (format spec: `docs/reporting-standard.md`);
  **`TIMELINE.md`** is the full sourced chronology. `STATUS.md`'s "What changed" table (headline subset) and
  its full counterpart **`docs/what-changed.md`** (all 17 provisions, deep-linked to the operative extracts)
  are the authority on what moved vs earlier reporting — consult them before asserting a feature of the
  proposal (several widely-reported features were deleted/moved by May).

## Adding a Council compromise text (the core workflow)

When asked to transcribe / add a new ST compromise version, **use the `transcribe-council-extract` skill**.
The canonical faithfulness rules live in `extracts/council/_TRANSCRIPTION_GUIDE.md` — read it first;
`extracts/commission/_TRANSCRIPTION_GUIDE.md` adapts them for the base text.

Why this is non-trivial: the PDFs carry tracked changes (~~strikethrough~~ = deletion, **bold** = addition).
Plain `pdftotext`/`get_text()` **destroys that formatting** and merges old+new tokens (e.g. `9672 hours`
for "~~72~~ **96** hours"), silently producing *wrong legal text*. The skill's `pdf_changes.py` recovers
the markup from the PDF's structure; `render_pdf.py` page images are the cross-check (esp. for inline
single-number/short-word swaps, which `pdf_changes.py` can flip). Both must agree before committing.

Driver commands (run from repo root; `pip install pymupdf cffi` first — `cffi` is required):

```bash
# 1. Map every change (DELETED/NEW/AMENDED) before writing — the guardrail
python3 .claude/skills/transcribe-council-extract/pdf_changes.py "<source.pdf>" --all --mode summary
# 2. Extract consolidated + marked text to transcribe from
python3 .claude/skills/transcribe-council-extract/pdf_changes.py "<source.pdf>" --pages 2-16 --mode both
# 3. Visual cross-check (read the /tmp/*.png with the Read tool; start with the cover page)
python3 .claude/skills/transcribe-council-extract/render_pdf.py "<source.pdf>" --pages 1,18,19
# 4. Internal link + #anchor check (must end "0 broken") — mirrors the lychee CI
python3 .claude/skills/transcribe-council-extract/linkcheck.py .
```

Transcribe the **consolidated** result (changes applied, markup not reproduced), using the document's
**own** article/recital numbering (numbering shifts between versions — never copy a later version's numbers
onto an earlier text). Mark whole-provision deletions `[DELETED in ST <nnnn>/26]`, undecided source
brackets `[...]` preserved as-is, illegible passages `[illegible in source]`. Then branch
`extracts/st-<nnnn>-<yyyy>`, commit the five files (not the `/tmp` PNGs), and PR to `main`.

## Adding an EP committee text (draft opinion / report / amendments)

When a Parliament committee text on the file appears (JURI/LIBE/ITRE/IMCO), **use the
`transcribe-parliament-extract` skill**; rules live in `extracts/parliament/_TRANSCRIPTION_GUIDE.md`.
Unlike Council texts there is no tracked-change redline to recover — transcribe the discrete
amendments as tabled (so `pdf_changes.py` does **not** apply; use `render_pdf.py` + `linkcheck.py`).

Two recurring traps:
- **Scope.** A committee can opine on *both* omnibus files — confirm the doc's own interinstitutional
  reference is **2025/0360(COD)** (data/cyber, incl. the **Data Act** strand of COM(2025) 837), not
  **2025/0359(COD)** (AI Act). Check the rapporteur too (JURI on 0360 = Benifei; JURI on 0359 =
  Lagodinsky). A listing-page summary can mis-attribute a row; the cover page is the tie-breaker.
- **doceo is WAF-blocked.** `www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/...` returns HTTP 202 (AWS-WAF JS challenge)
  to all non-browser clients, for both `.pdf` and `.docx` — `curl`/WebFetch get 0 bytes. Confirm
  existence/metadata via the committee *documents* pages and OEIL, but obtain the operative text via a
  **browser download** or a non-WAF mirror, commit it under `sources/parliament/`, then transcribe. If
  only metadata is confirmed, register metadata-only and set `pending_operative_text: true` — never
  assert per-provision content from a screenshot or a journalist's summary.

## Conventions

- **Relative links only** inside the repo — never `github.com/...` absolute URLs (they break on rename/fork/mirror).
- **Deep-link into `extracts/*.md#anchor`, not `sources/*.pdf#page`** — GitHub's PDF viewer can't anchor to a page.
- **Document naming:** `<INSTITUTIONAL-ID>_<short-description>_<ISO-date>.<ext>` — stable number first, ISO
  date last, so chronological sort works (e.g. `ST-9547-2026_council-presidency-compromise_2026-05-21.pdf`).
- **Link checking (CI):** `lychee` runs on push/PR/weekly via `.github/workflows/link-check.yml`, configured
  by `lychee.toml`. Internal links are checked strictly; some external hosts (consilium register, EUR-Lex,
  Oeil, LinkedIn) are excluded because they bot-block or 404 for unreleased LIMITE docs.
